# Mensa Notifier

Mensa notifier parses an XML mensa (= German university cafeteria) menu to notify the user of the day's offerings. The script sends notifications via [ntfy.sh](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) and is intended to be run daily with a cronjob.

## To-Do:
- [ ] refactor redundant curl calls
- [ ] split into multiple files
